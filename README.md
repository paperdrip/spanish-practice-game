# Spanish Practice Game

This is a simple, web-based quiz game designed to help users practice their Spanish language skills. The game is built as a single-page application using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It's fully responsive and works on both desktop and mobile browsers.

## Features

The quiz covers three key areas of Spanish vocabulary and grammar:

- **Acciones Habituales (Common Verbs)**: Users are tested on translating common Spanish verbs to English and vice-versa. The verb data is loaded dynamically from a CSV file.

- **Telling Time**: Questions challenge the user to match the Spanish written form of a time (e.g., "Son las dos y cuarto") with its digital representation (e.g., "2:15").

- **Verbos Reflexivos (Reflexive Verbs)**: Users must complete sentences by choosing the correct reflexive pronoun (me, te, se, etc.) or the correct reflexive verb infinitive.

### Core Gameplay Mechanics

- **Multiple-Choice Format**: Each question presents four possible answers.

- **Instant Feedback**: After selecting an answer, the interface immediately shows whether the choice was correct or incorrect, along with a brief explanation.

- **Quiz Structure**: Each session consists of 20 randomly selected questions (10 common verbs, 5 time questions, and 5 reflexive verb questions).

- **Summary Screen**: At the end of the quiz, a summary screen displays the final score and a detailed review of all questions, showing the user's answer and the correct answer.

- **Replayability**: Users can easily start a new quiz with a fresh set of questions from the summary screen.
